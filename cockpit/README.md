# Subscription-manager
**A Cockpit plugin to administer candlepin subscriptions**

Development Quickstart
----------------------
Run `vagrant up`. subscription-manager cockpit plugin code lands in
`/vagrant/cockpit`.

Once the VM is up, cockpit is accessible via https://centos7.subman.example.com:9090 (must have vagrant hostmanager plugin installed). The fedora VM works similarly.

NPM scripts (documented below) should be used to rebuild plugin artifacts when
code is edited.

Development Outside of Vagrant
------------------------------
> Important note for Red Hat developers: When you try to develop cockpit plugin
outside Red Hat office, then you needn't to do any changes of configuration file.
In case you are Red Hat developer working in Red Hat office, then please use
our internal cache of nmpjs repository called Nexus. All you need to do is change
symbolic link: `rm -f yarn.lock; ln -s yarn.lock.nexus yarn.lock`. There are
two lock files: `yarn.lock.npmjs` (for community users) and `yarn.lock.nexus` (for
Red Hat developers). In case you did some big change in `yarn.lock.npmjs` and you
want to have similar change in `yarn.lock.nexus`, then you can use following
regul expression:

`%s/registry.yarnpkg.com/repository.engineering.redhat.com\/nexus\/repository\/registry.npmjs.org/g`

 - `nvm` is recommended but not required (https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
 - `yarn` needs to be installed globally (`npm install -g yarn`).
 - `yarn install` needs to be run from the `cockpit` subdirectory.

With these steps, the cockpit plugin code can be built from the host.

Yarn
----
Yarn is used to install, remove, and update NPM packages for the plugin.

The most common commands are:
 - `yarn add <package> --dev`: Add a JavaScript dependency.
 - `yarn install`: Install JavaScript dependencies and update the lockfile if
   necessary.

(See https://yarnpkg.com for more details on using yarn).

> When you are using our Nexus repository and you added some dependency using
`yarn add <package>`, then please update `yarn.lock.npmjs` file. Vice verse, when
you are community contributor and you added some package, then please update
`yarn.lock.nexus` too.

NPM Scripts
-----------
There are several commands configured in `package.json`, these should be run
from the `cockpit` subdirectory:
 - `npm run build` - do a build of the JavaScript source with results in `dist`
 - `npm run watch` - monitor the source for changes and rebuild the cockpit
   plugin when necessary.
 - `npm run vagrant-watch`: same as `npm run watch`, and also invokes
   `vagrant rsync-auto`. Useful if you want to develop on the host and see the
   effects in a VM.
